jquery-repeat-element
=====================

JQuery plugin to create repeated instances of a given element, within a parent element.
Each instances is optionally bound to a data object, using a set of conventions.
Examples include table elements (`<tr>` within `<tbody>`) and list elements (`<li>` within `<ul>`).

The user specifies the element to be repeated as a prototype,
with various conventions indicating how specific sub-elements within
the prototype are to be initialized with data.
